# The API weather challenge

## What does it do

The application calls Musement's catalogue for the list of cities and then gets a forecast from api.weatherapi.com
for each of them for today and tomorrow.

## Installation and using

1. Set an environmental variable with the name of WEATHER_API_KEY with the value of a valid weatherapi.com site key,
in order for the application to work.

2. Launch the app

`php index.php > "result.txt"`
